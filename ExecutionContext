How a Javascript code works?

Java script code uses execution conext to run its code.
What is execution context how it works?

Execution context is made up of 2 phases. 
1. Memory Phase
2. Code execution phase

Memory Phase - JS skims through the code and allocates memory to each variable in the code 
Code execution phase - Here exactly code is executed by running through each line of code sequentially.

var n = 2;
function Square(num){
var ans = num*num;
return ans;
}
var sqr1 = Square(n);
var sqr2 = Square(4);

Phase 1 - Memory allocation
n = undefined.
square = {..}
sqr1 = undefined.
sqr2 = undefined.

Phase 2 - Code execution phase
1. n = 2
